This directory contains example ideal files to be used for testing.  If
everything's working, ideal should handle all files in this directory without
error.

Each bad* file contains code that triggers (or used to trigger) a specific
error; each man* file contains an example from the user's manual.

Eventually there will be a test harness to automate testing.
